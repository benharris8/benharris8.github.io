      <p>Hi there, I'm Ben Harris.</p>
      <p className="main-content">
        I'm a Junior Software Engineer who recently graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course,
        a 14 week intensive programming course aimed at teaching students up-to-date web development technologies and practices.
        <br />
        <br />
        After graduating, I am splitting my time between learning C++ and working on a 'Book Diary' application using the MERN stack.
